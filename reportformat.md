GUIDELINES FOR THE PREPARATION OF A PROJECT REPORT 

1.1 	INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT REPORT 
 
                 A project report plays a significant role in the evaluation process of Summer Internship Course. It serves as a comprehensive documentation of the project undertaken by the student. The report provides insights into the project's objectives, methodologies, findings, and conclusions. It highlights the student's ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios and showcases their analytical and problem-solving skills.
The report is examined by Faculty Mentor responsible for grading and evaluation. The Mentor evaluates the content, organization, clarity, and overall quality of the report. During the scrutiny process, the Faculty Mentor considers various aspects, including the alignment of the project with the stated objectives, the methodology used, the accuracy and completeness of the data, the analysis and interpretation of results, and the effectiveness of the conclusions and recommendations. The Mentor also looks for proper citation and acknowledgment of sources used in the project.
  Here in this note we present a format with appropriate guidelines on writing a report on the Summer Internship project. It is therefore expected that all the reports submitted by the interns must conform to the suggested format and structure. 
1.2 	PAGE SET-UP & NUMBER OF COPIES 
 
 	The size of the report should be such that it is easy to use, handle, and preserve the report. 
Also, the writing should be such that a reader is able to read it with ease. 
 	For this purpose, please note the following: 
(a)	Size 9” x 11”, which is called the quarto size and is usually known as the “thesis size”(A4). 
(b)	Writing of the report: The report should be written or typed in double space on one side of the sheet and the pages should be numbered serially. 
(c)	Margin: About 1” on all the four sides of the sheet. 
(d)	No. of copies: Two hardbound bound copies must be submitted. 
 
1.3 	CONTENTS OF PROJECT REPORT 
  
 	Apart from the top cover, the report should contain the following: 
(a)	Cover page 
(b)	Internship Completion Certificate 
(c)	Joining Report 
(d)	Acknowledgements 
(e)	Abstract Sheet 
(f)	Table of Contents 
(g)	A brief introduction of the organization’s business sector 
(h)	Overview of the organization 
(i)	Plan of your internship program 
(j)	Introduction 
(k)	Main Text 
(l)	Outcomes 
(m)	Conclusions and/or Recommendations 
(n)	Appendices (if necessary) 
(o)	References 
We now elaborate these items in some detail. 
 
(a) Cover page 
These are the first pages of the report. It should contain the title of the report, name(s) of the author(s), name of the organization and the name of the institute. The format of these pages should adhere to the specifications. Title should not exceed 100 characters including blanks, etc. 
(b) Internship Completion Certificate 
The prescribed format of certificate to be issued by the supervisor from industry must be mandatorily part of your final project report. The template for the same is given in Appendix. 
(c) Joining Report 
Please see Appendix for the Joining Report Format. 
(d) Acknowledgements 
There are many people who may have helped a student during the work carried out by him/her in his/her project. It is one’s duty to acknowledge it and thank them for their help.  
 Customarily, thanks are due to the following in the order given below:  (i) 	Head of the organization (Vice Chancellor and Dean) 
(ii) 	Industry Mentor in charge of the project 
(iii)	Faculty Mentor of the University 
(iv)	Any other persons (from the organization and/or outside the organization, etc) 
(e) Abstract 
This is the third page of the report. The abstract is a crucial component of a project report as it provides a concise summary of the entire project. A reader, on going through it, should be able to know what the project is, who wrote it and under whose supervision, what has been done (in brief), how it has been done, what the main results are, etc. 
The abstract should be written in a clear and concise manner, using language that is understandable to a wide range of readers. It should be self-contained and provide sufficient information to give readers a solid understanding of the project's scope, methodology, and findings. The abstract serves as a crucial reference point for readers to determine whether they want to delve deeper into the full project report. It is important to note that while the abstract provides a condensed overview, it should not include excessive detail or technical jargon. Instead, it should focus on conveying the main points of the project in a concise and engaging manner. Only in unusual cases should it contain more than 200 words. The nomenclatures used should be meaningful, that is, only standard terminology should be used.  
(f) Table of Contents 
The table of contents in a project report follows a similar structure to that of a book. It provides a systematic outline of the main divisions and subdivisions of the report, along with the corresponding page numbers.
  
For example: 
 
 	CONTENTS  	 	 	 	     Page no. 
 
Introduction 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  	5 
1.1 … 	 	 	 	 	 	 	    	5 
1.2 … 	 	 	 	 	 	 	    	6 
 
(g) A brief introduction of the organization’s business sector (Note: 1 Page maximum) 
Provide an overview of the main area or business sector in which the organization operates in, i.e., telecommunications, manufacturing, financial service etc. Here you should discuss the main business sector and NOT the organization under consideration. For example, if the organization is in the telecommunication sector, then you should briefly describe all aspects of this sector in Indian context. You should NOT include an introduction of your company here as this would be covered in the next section. 
(h) Overview of the organization (Note: 3 Pages maximum) 
•	Brief history 
•	Business size (Total number of stocks, commodities, number of employees etc) 
•	Product lines (list complete range of products/services) 
•	Competitors 
•	Brief summary of all departments 
(i) Plan of your internship program 
•	A brief introduction of the branch/department when you performed your internship 
•	Start and end dates of your internship 
•	The names of the departments you visited and the duration of stay 
•	Duties and responsibilities performed (Provide a detailed description of your duties and responsibilities, describe the project you were assigned 
(j) Background and description of the problem 
In this the problem is introduced. So, the introduction should contain the purpose of the report, sufficient background material, including literature survey to present the reader a clear picture of the work. An outline of the work should also form a part of the introduction. 
The purpose of writing the introduction is to arouse the curiosity of the reader in the report. Therefore, a proper and interesting introduction should include a brief history of the topic coupled with the statement of the immediate problem, the reasons for interest in it and a discussion of the method of attack or treatment. Generally, an introduction is not more than one page. Therefore, a proper and interesting introduction should include a brief history of the topic coupled with the statement of the immediate problem, the reasons for interest in it and a discussion of the method of attack or treatment.  
(k) Main Text 
 In this the work, the method of treatment and the results are presented. It may run into one or more than one chapters/section under different headings and sub-headings. 
 	It should ideally contain the following:  
•	Assumptions made, 
•	Experimental work/data collection,  
•	The survey done, or algorithm presented,
•	A description of activities or programs or case studies outlined,  
•	The results obtained/illustrations,  
•	The discussion and interpretations, etc. 
 	Significant discrepancies in results should be called to the reader’s attention, even when it is admitted that no reasonable explanation can be offered.  
 (l) Outcomes 
The principal outcomes as identified from the results of your analysis are to be highlighted in this section preferably in bulleted form. 
(m) 	Conclusions and/or Recommendations (if any) 
The conclusions and recommendations are based on the discussions and interpretations of the results obtained. It would be helpful to the reader if other possibilities pertaining to the stated conclusions and recommendations are discussed. 
(n) Appendices (if necessary) 
The contents of an appendix are essentially those that support or elaborate the matter in the main text. divert the attention of the reader from the main problem, is generally put into the Appendix. We give below some broad items, which normally form part of the appendix. These are: 
• Calculation Sheets/ Lengthy derivations of mathematical formulae (if that is not the project itself)./ Supplementary details of instructions/ Flow charts/ Computer programs/ Questionnaires/ Large maps/ Nomenclature, etc. 
NOTE for CS students: If the project itself is to make a computer program of some problem, then flow charts and the computer program have to be in the main body. One is expected to decide according to one’s own need. 
 (o) References 
All the references should be given in the section called References. We cite below two examples of writing references. 
Suppose we have to refer to a paper entitled An Integral Equation Satisfied by the Square of Webers’ Parabolic Cylindrical Function, whose author is S.C. Mitra and which appeared in the Journal of the London Mathematical Society whose volume is 11, the year of publication 1936, and the article is published on pages 252 to 256. We shall write it as follows: 
 Mitra, S. C., “An Integral Equation Satisfied by the Square of Webers’ Parabolic Cylindrical Function” Jour. Lond. Math. Soc., 11 (1936), pp. 252-256. 
Suppose we have to refer to a book called An Introduction to Linear Algebra by Dr. V. Krishnamurty and others which was published by Affiliated East West Press Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi in the year 1976. This we shall write as: 
 Krishnamurty, V. & others, An Introduction to Linear Algebra Ist edition, Affiliated East West Press, New Delhi (1976).
